## About
This project is a tiny personal app I'm using to keep track of the episodes of My Hero Academia anime version I've watched so far, as well as the feature movies and the OVAs.

## Database
A RDBMS, such as MariaDB, is needed to run the project. A dump of the database will be made available later on. 

## Miscellaneous

This project is powered by PHP 8.2. The front is done through Sass and jQuery. Because Kanjis, Hiraganas and Katakanas are used, the Japanese version of the Noto Sans CJK font will be used. Icons are provided through Google Material Symbols font.
